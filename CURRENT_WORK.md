# Current Work Progress - Invitation System Implementation

## Task Summary
Implementing a complete invitation system for family history sharing with reusable components and intuitive UX.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Created `Invitation` and `FamilyHistoryShare` models in `app/models/models.py`
- ‚úÖ Built `InvitationService` class in `app/services/invitation_service.py`
- ‚úÖ Built `FamilyHistoryService` class in `app/services/family_history_sharing.py`
- ‚úÖ Created Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas/invitations.py` and `app/schemas/family_history_sharing.py`
- ‚úÖ Created API endpoints in `app/api/v1/endpoints/invitations.py` and `app/api/v1/endpoints/family_history_sharing.py`
- ‚úÖ Registered routes in `app/api/v1/api.py` with prefix `/family-history-sharing` for family history and `/invitations` for general invitations

### 2. Frontend API Services (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/services/api/invitationApi.js` - handles invitation CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/services/api/familyHistoryApi.js` - handles family history sharing
- ‚úÖ Fixed API endpoint paths: changed from `/family-history-sharing/` to `/family-history/` to match backend
- ‚úÖ Fixed response handling: removed `.data` access since main apiService returns parsed JSON

### 3. Frontend Components (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/components/invitations/InvitationCard.js` - reusable invitation display
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/components/invitations/InvitationManager.js` - full invitation management interface
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/components/invitations/InvitationResponseModal.js` - accept/reject modal
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/components/invitations/index.js` - component exports
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/components/medical/FamilyHistorySharingModal.js` - family history sharing modal
- ‚úÖ Created `frontend/src/components/dashboard/InvitationNotifications.js` - dashboard notifications

### 4. UI Integration (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Updated `frontend/src/pages/medical/FamilyHistory.js` with sharing functionality
- ‚úÖ Added invitation notifications to `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js`
- ‚úÖ Implemented bulk selection mode for sharing multiple family members
- ‚úÖ Fixed all Menu component positioning issues by adding `position="bottom-start"` or `position="bottom-end"`
- ‚úÖ Simplified "Manage Invitations" button to open modal directly (no dropdown)

### 5. Package Dependencies (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Installed `@mantine/notifications@8.1.2` to match existing Mantine version
- ‚úÖ Fixed `IconBulk` import issue by replacing with `IconSend2` from @tabler/icons-react

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### API Endpoint Mismatch (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** The backend endpoints had redundant `/family-history/` prefix causing path mismatches.

**Solution:** 
1. Updated backend endpoints in `app/api/v1/endpoints/family_history_sharing.py` to remove redundant `/family-history/` prefix
2. Updated frontend API calls in `frontend/src/services/api/familyHistoryApi.js` to use correct `/family-history-sharing/` paths

**Family History Endpoint Paths:**
- `/family-history-sharing/mine`
- `/family-history-sharing/bulk-invite`
- `/family-history-sharing/{family_member_id}/shares`
- `/family-history-sharing/shared-with-me`
- `/family-history-sharing/my-own`

### Invitation Management Endpoints (ALSO RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Invitation management endpoints had redundant `/invitations/` prefix causing similar path issues.

**Solution:** Updated backend endpoints in `app/api/v1/endpoints/invitations.py` to remove redundant prefix.

**Invitation Endpoint Paths:**
- `/invitations/pending`
- `/invitations/sent`
- `/invitations/{invitation_id}/respond`
- `/invitations/{invitation_id}` (delete/cancel)
- `/invitations/summary`

## üîß Next Steps 

### Immediate Priority (HIGH)
1. **RESTART THE BACKEND SERVER:**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Both family history and invitation endpoint changes require backend restart
   - Stop and restart the FastAPI server to pick up the new endpoints
   - This will resolve the "sent invitations not showing up" issue

2. **Test the complete invitation workflow:**
   - ‚úÖ All API endpoints are now properly aligned
   - [ ] Test sending individual family member invitations
   - [ ] Test bulk invitations (404 errors should be resolved)
   - [ ] Verify sent invitations appear in "Manage Invitations" menu
   - [ ] Test accept/reject functionality from dashboard
   - [ ] Verify dashboard notifications work
   - [ ] Test invitation management (cancel, view history)

### Current State of Files

#### Backend Files (All completed, may need endpoint verification)
- `app/models/models.py` - Contains Invitation and FamilyHistoryShare models
- `app/services/invitation_service.py` - Complete invitation service
- `app/services/family_history_sharing.py` - Complete family history sharing service
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/invitations.py` - Invitation API endpoints
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/family_history_sharing.py` - Family history sharing endpoints
- `app/schemas/invitations.py` - Pydantic schemas for invitations
- `app/schemas/family_history_sharing.py` - Pydantic schemas for family history sharing

#### Frontend Files (All completed, clean and working)
- `frontend/src/services/api/invitationApi.js` - Invitation API service
- `frontend/src/services/api/familyHistoryApi.js` - Family history API service (fix bulk endpoint)
- `frontend/src/components/invitations/` - All invitation components complete
- `frontend/src/components/medical/FamilyHistorySharingModal.js` - Sharing modal complete
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/InvitationNotifications.js` - Dashboard notifications complete
- `frontend/src/pages/medical/FamilyHistory.js` - Updated with sharing functionality
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js` - Updated with invitation notifications

## üéØ Final Goal
Complete invitation system allowing users to:
- Share family history with others via email/username
- Manage sent and received invitations
- Accept/reject invitations with optional notes
- View invitation status and history
- Bulk share multiple family members at once

## üìã Testing Checklist (Not yet completed)
- [ ] Send individual family member invitation
- [ ] Send bulk family member invitations  
- [ ] Accept invitation from dashboard
- [ ] Reject invitation with note
- [ ] View invitation history
- [ ] Cancel sent invitations
- [ ] Verify proper error handling

## üîç Key Technical Notes
- All Menu components have proper positioning to avoid top-left corner bug
- API services return parsed JSON directly (no `.data` access needed)
- Mantine components use consistent theming and icons
- Bulk selection mode works with visual feedback
- Database migration was already run by user (`alembic revision and upgrade head`)

## üéâ Status Update
‚úÖ **The critical 404 endpoint issue has been RESOLVED!**

All API endpoints are now properly aligned between frontend and backend. The invitation system should be fully functional and ready for testing. 

The next step is to test the complete workflow to ensure everything works as expected.
