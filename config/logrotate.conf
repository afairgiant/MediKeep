# Logrotate configuration for Medical Records Management System
# Copy this file to /etc/logrotate.d/medical-records in production

# Configure log directory based on deployment
# For Docker containers: /app/logs/*.log
# For local deployment: adjust path as needed
/app/logs/*.log {
    # Rotation frequency
    daily
    
    # Also rotate when files exceed size limit (both conditions)
    size 5M
    
    # Keep 30 days of logs (adjust based on LOG_RETENTION_DAYS)
    rotate 30
    
    # Compress old logs to save space
    compress
    
    # Don't compress the most recent rotated log (in case app is still writing)
    delaycompress
    
    # Don't error if log file is missing
    missingok
    
    # Don't rotate empty files
    notifempty
    
    # Use copytruncate to avoid issues with applications holding file handles
    # This copies the log file and truncates the original instead of moving it
    copytruncate
    
    # Create new log files with specific permissions
    create 644 root root
